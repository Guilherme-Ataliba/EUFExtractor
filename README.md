# EUF Exam Randomizer

A work‑in‑progress Python tool to transform past EUF solution manuals into fresh practice exams by stripping out the pre‑selected answers and shuffling the choices.

## 📋 What It Is

Physicists in Brazil must pass the EUF exam to enter master’s and doctoral programs. Previous years’ tests are only available as “solutions” PDFs, with the correct choice always marked first. This project automates:

1. **Extraction** of questions and answer options from a solutions manual PDF  
2. **Removal** of the pre‑selected answer  
3. **Randomization** of all answer options  
4. **Reconstruction** of a new PDF that looks and feels like an actual EUF exam
